My Awesome Project
This is my project using Chicago Art Institute's API endpoints. This project displays data for 10 exhibitions, and also displays data on artwork based on your searches.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

I used this project to further delve into using React and React Hooks. Though I do have experience working with APIs, I was able to delve deeper into react by using Routes, useEffect, and useState. I also was able to use this project as an opportunity for active recall on basic principles and syntax of react, suchas passing props and setting up components.

Optimizations
I did struggle with useEffect. This project gave me an opportunity to understand useEffect better, and learn how to implement it better, by having the appropriate dependencies, knowing why useEffect exists and when to use it, and understanding the reason that react runs the way it does. 

Prerequisites
npm

How to run the code
It's very easy to run this app: Just follow these directions:
npm install
npm start
